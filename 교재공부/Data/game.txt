The eighth and final season of the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones, produced by HBO, premiered on April 14, 2019, and concluded on May 19, 2019. Unlike the first six seasons, which consisted of ten episodes each, and the seventh season, which consisted of seven episodes, the eighth season consists of only six episodes.
The final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne. The first half of the season involves many of the main characters converging at Winterfell with their armies in an effort to repel the Night King and his army of White Walkers and wights. The second half of the season resumes the war for the throne as Queen Daenerys Targaryen assaults King's Landing in an attempt to unseat Queen Cersei Lannister as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.
The season was filmed from October 2017 to July 2018 and largely consists of original content not found in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, while also incorporating material that Martin has revealed to showrunners about the upcoming novels in the series, The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring. The season was adapted for television by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.
The season received mixed reviews from critics, in contrast to the positive reviews of previous seasons, and is the lowest-rated of the series on the website Rotten Tomatoes and the only one with a "Rotten" rating. Criticism was mainly directed at the condensed story and shorter runtime of the season, as well as numerous creative decisions made by the showrunners, though the acting and production values were highly praised.
Despite the mixed critical reception, the season received 32 nominations at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, the most for a single season of television in history.[1]
